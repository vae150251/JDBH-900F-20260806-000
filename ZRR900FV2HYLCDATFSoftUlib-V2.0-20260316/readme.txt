Example description
===================
This example shows how to configure the TIM2 peripheral to generate four different 
signals with four different frequencies.

The TIM2CLK frequency is set to 36 MHz, the Prescaler is set to 0x2, and used in 
Output Compare Toggle Mode.

TIM2 counter clock = TIMxCLK / (Prescaler +1) = 12 MHz 

The TIM2 CC1 register value is equal to 0x8000: 
CC1 update rate = TIM2 counter clock / CCR1_Val = 366.2 Hz,
so the TIM2 Channel 1 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 183.1 Hz.

The TIM2 CC2 register is equal to 0x4000:
CC2 update rate = TIM2 counter clock / CCR2_Val = 732.4 Hz
so the TIM2 channel 2 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 366.3 Hz.

The TIM2 CC3 register is equal to 0x2000:
CC3 update rate = TIM2 counter clock / CCR3_Val = 1464.8 Hz
so the TIM2 channel 3 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 732.4 Hz.

The TIM2 CC4 register is equal to 0x1000:
CC4 update rate = TIM2 counter clock / CCR4_Val =  2929.6 Hz
so the TIM2 channel 4 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 1464.8 Hz.



Directory contents
==================
stm32F10x_conf.h  Library Configuration file
stm32F10x_it.c    Interrupt handlers
stm32F10x_it.h    Interrupt handlers header file
main.c            Main program


Hardware environment
====================
Connect an oscilloscope on:
- PA.00 (TIM2_CH1)
- PA.01 (TIM2_CH2)
- PA.02 (TIM2_CH3)
- PA.03 (TIM2_CH4)
to show the four different signals.
  
  
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files:
  + stm32F10x_lib.c
  + stm32F10x_tim.c
  + stm32F10x_gpio.c
  + stm32F10x_rcc.c
  + stm32F10x_nvic.c
  + stm32F10x_flash.c

- Link all compiled files and load your image into either RAM or Flash
- Run the example
